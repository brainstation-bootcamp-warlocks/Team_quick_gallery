# Team_quick_gallery

Welcome to the Team_quick_gallery wiki!

Should be done:
- [x] Tony: Setup API calls through Axios for getting objects of culture=Afghan
- [x] Irina: Create a new web component for gallery-cards (at least an <img> tag with src, or background image attribute), something like a "GalleryCard" class with render() method.
- [x] Irina: Update the main page a bit more, so there's a central gallery tile section.
- [x] Irina: Have it so that the central gallery tile section has one GalleryCard, and image source could be anything
- [x] Tony: BIG POINT: Integrate the new GalleryCard with the list of gallery objects (e.g. have a main flexbox div where it has a bunch of GalleryCard objects where each object has a different image source).

Nice to have:
- [x] Tony: Have a dropdown wheel that gets populated by criteria (e.g. culture), and fill it up.
- [x] Tony: Have it so that the dropdown wheel selection updates the selected culture variable.
- [ ] Tony: Have it so that we can actually get more pages

Next Stage:
- [ ] Irina: In the main page, change up styling to resemble the metropolitan art museum page
- [ ] Irina: In the main page, have a logo (could be the met logo, or a picture)
- [ ] Irina:In the gallery card, have it so that there's title, year, and artist in the bottom. 
- [ ] Tony: Link to the met api intead of the harvard one
- [ ] Tony: Have it so that when you click on a card, it links to the actual page.
